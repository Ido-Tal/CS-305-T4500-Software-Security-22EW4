### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that builds financial plans for their clients that include retirement, savings, investments, and insurance. They have their own application that they use to transfer information between their clients and Artemis financial, and the application is also used to retrieve important financial information about their clients. As a result of having to handle sensitive information, Artemis financial have hired us to assess potential security threats that exist in their application and ways to prevent potential threats from causing harm to them or their clients. The main focus of the project was about identifying practices that Artemis Finacial should adopt to improve their security.

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I did well in testing for potential vulnerabilities in their code by using static testing. It is important to code securely as to prevent malicious users from exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining access to information that they should not have access to, in addition to making sure that information is only available to users that have proper authorization. Good software security adds to a company's wellbeing by making clients and customers trust the company in handling their information and transactions, and it helps the company build a good reputation as being reliable which could help the company prosper. Bad software security could scare potential clients and customers from doing business with a company since it could be considered too risky.

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

When working through the vulnerabiluty assessment I found the dependecy check tool to be very helpful. This was because it showed me many vulnerabilities that existed in the code, which is something that I would find challenging to do with just me having to search and check for each vulnerability individually.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approached the need to increase the layers of security by testing and checking what caused most of the vulnerabilities. After that I noticed that most of the vulnerabilities were due to using an older version of the libraries that needed to being used for the code for Artemis Financials application. In the future it would be important to perform penetration testing to search for futher security risks and to plan various mitigation techniques.

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?



### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?



### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
